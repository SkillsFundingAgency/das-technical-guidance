# Code Reviews

Code reviews are an essential part of the development process and must be carried out on all code regardless of where the change originates. The process should also be carried out with the appropriate rigour and attention. Some things to keep in mind during the code review process:

* Give reviews your full attention
* Limit the amount of time you spend reviewing in any one sitting
* In the main you should check the code out during the review and test it locally
* Give **constructive** feedback
* Consider including non-developers in the review process, they may pick up different issues
* Do not merge code when there are unresolved comments or requests for change
* * Code merging in the main is a responsibility of the Quality Assurance team and will performed after review from the Product Owner
