# Code Reviews

Code reviews are an essential part of the development process and must be carried out on all code regardless of where the change originates. The process should also be carried out with the appropriate rigour and attention. Some things to keep in mind during the code review process:

* Give reviews your full attention
* Limit the amount of time you spend reviewing in any one sitting
* If necessary check the code out and test it locally
* Give constructive feedback
* Consider including non-developers in the review process, they may pick up different issues
* Do not merge code when there are unresolved comments or requests for change
