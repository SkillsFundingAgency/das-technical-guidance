## Aims and Objectives

This section sets of the key aims and objectives of the AS in defining API standards.

|Objective   | Solution  | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Achieve a standard way of structuring application solutions | Define a set of principles and standards to ensure new applications have a standard structure | Take inspiration from current applications that have a proven structure (such as [Onion Architecture - Jeffery Palermo](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/)) |
| Ensure consistency across solutions |Provide a consistent _Apprenticeship Service_ structure to applications that will feel familiar to all developers on the Apprenticeship Service||||
