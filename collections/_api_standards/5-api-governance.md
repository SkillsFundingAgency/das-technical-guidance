## Governance

The AS does not wish to implement a heavyweight API governance and review process, as we feel this will inhibit the ability of the agile teams to deliver business value quickly.  However, we do need to balance the needs of agile, with the needs of quality and consistency.

If you plan to deliver a new API, please contact the AS quality guild.  You will be asked to come and present an outline of your new API and answer questions related to the standards defined above.  

If your API is external, additional governance will apply.  Please liaise with the AS Quality Guild early in the lifecycle of your API delivery to prevent unnecessary re-work later.
