## Governance

The AS does not wish to implement a heavyweight API governance and review process, as we feel this will inhibit the ability of the agile teams to deliver business value quickly.  However, we do need to balance the needs of agile, with the needs of quality and consistency.

If you plan to deliver a new API, you must ensure that you engage with the Architect associated with your project, (or the central Architect group if one is not specifically allocated to your project), and do so before work is started on the API.  The Architect will help you design the API in accordance with these standards, and will also handle any broader Governance (such as potentially presenting to the Quality Guild), for critical APIs or external APIs.  Please liaise with the Architecture community early in the lifecycle of your API delivery to prevent unnecessary re-work later.
