This guide provides the standards which are to be applied to any new applications developed within the Apprenticeship Service with the aims as outlined below.

## Aims and Objectives


|Objective|Solution|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Achieve a standard way of structuring application solutions | Define a set of principles and standards to ensure new applications have a standard structure | Take inspiration from current applications that have a proven structure (such as [Onion Architecture - Jeffery Palermo](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/)) |
|Ensure consistency across solutions |Provide a consistent _Apprenticeship Service_ structure to applications that will feel familiar to all developers on the Apprenticeship Service||
|Allow us to build performant, scalable and secure applications and services|Use industry best practices and engineering patterns that are proven to create fast, scalable and secure applications and services||


The guide is split into the following sections.
