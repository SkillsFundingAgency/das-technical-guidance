# Apprenticeship Service API Standards

## Introduction

The Apprenticeship Service API Standards draw influence from the following.

- [API technical and data standards (v2 - 2019)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards)
- [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice)
- DfE API Strategy - May 2019, V3.0 (no link available)

This guide provides the standards which are to be applied to any new APIs developed within the Apprenticeship Service.

The guide is split into the following sections.
